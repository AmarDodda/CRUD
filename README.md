# React + Vite

This is a simple React application for managing user data. It allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on user records. The app fetches user data from a mock API provided by JSONPlaceholder(https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users) and allows users to add, edit, and delete user records.

Features:
-> View a list of existing users fetched from the mock API.
-> Add new users with their name, email, and username.
-> Edit existing users' details.
-> Delete users from the list.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
